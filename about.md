## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student focusing on knowledge graphs. My main research interests include knowledge extraction, entity linking, relation extraction, QA, and GNNs. I am currently employed at the University of Hamburg, where I am involved in teaching the Data Engineering course and the Knowledge Graph course.

Before my Ph.D. studies, I worked at Fraunhofer IAIS in Dresden, where I was involved in the design and implementation of a Dialog System. I graduated from TU Dresden with a diploma in Computer Science.
