## About Me
I am a dedicated Ph.D. student with a strong passion for knowledge graphs. My research interests encompass knowledge extraction, entity linking, relation extraction, QA, and GNNs. I am currently employed at the University of Hamburg, where I contribute to the teaching of the Data Engineering course and the Knowledge Graph course.

Before my Ph.D. studies, I gained valuable experience working at Fraunhofer IAIS in Dresden, where I played a key role in the design and implementation of a Dialog System. I hold a diploma in Computer Science from TU Dresden.

With a solid academic background and professional experience, I am eager to tackle new challenges and make significant contributions to the field.
